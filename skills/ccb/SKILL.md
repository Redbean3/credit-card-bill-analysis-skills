description: Analyze Chinese credit card statement PDFs, especially招商银行/CMB账单, by converting PDFs with uv/MarkItDown, parsing transaction details, matching and excluding refunded purchases, classifying spending, and generating Markdown reports, SVG pie/daily charts, and CSV transaction exports. Use when the user asks to analyze a credit-card bill,账单, PDF statement, refund-aware消费分类, spending pie chart, or daily spending chart.

# CCB (Credit Card Bill)

Use this skill to turn a credit-card statement PDF or MarkItDown-generated Markdown into a local spending analysis. The bundled script is tuned for CMB/招商银行 credit-card statements like `招商银行信用卡对账单` with sections such as `还款`, `分期`, `退款`, and `消费`.

## Workflow

1. Locate the bill file in the user workspace.
2. If the input is a PDF, convert it to Markdown with uv/MarkItDown:

```bash
uvx --from 'markitdown[all]' markitdown 'statement.pdf' -o 'statement.md'
```

If `uv` is missing, install it only after approval. Prefer the official Astral installer or the user's existing package manager. If MarkItDown is already installed as a uv tool, `markitdown input.pdf -o output.md` is fine.

3. Run the bundled analyzer on the Markdown:

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_cmb_credit_card_bill.py 'statement.md'
```

Use `--out <dir>` to choose the output directory, `--year YYYY` when the statement year cannot be inferred, and `--top-categories N` to change how many category detail sections are included.

4. Open or summarize the generated report. Do not paste full sensitive transaction details into chat unless the user explicitly asks.

## Refund Handling

The analyzer uses this spending-analysis口径:

- Exclude repayments from消费分析.
- Treat positive `消费` and `分期` rows as charges.
- Treat negative `退款` and negative `分期` rows as refunds.
- Match a refund to an equal-amount positive charge whose transaction date is not later than the refund date.
- Exclude the matched positive charge from classification and charts.
- Keep unmatched refunds as账单调整, not as negative spending in a category.

This preserves both views:

- 分类分析合计: positive charges after matched-refund exclusions.
- 净账单口径: 分类分析合计 minus unmatched refunds, useful for checking against本期应还金额.

## Category Rules

The script applies deterministic keyword rules:

- `食堂` is its own category for canteen-like merchants.
- `滴滴`, `滴滴顺风车`, `滴滴出行`, `高德打车`, `交通`, `一卡通`, and similar travel keywords go to `出行交通`.
- Food, takeaway, drink, grocery, and supermarket-like merchants go to `其他饮食/食品商超`.
- Pinduoduo/Tmall/Taobao-like online purchases and named ecommerce merchants go to `电商购物`.
- Bilibili, iCloud, Lenovo-like merchants go to `数码娱乐/订阅`.
- SF Express, Hive Box, printing, and similar services go to `生活服务/物流`.
- Ambiguous personal or nickname merchants go to `其他/个人商户`.

If the user disputes a category, patch `CATEGORY_RULES` or the `categorize()` function in the bundled script and rerun it. Keep category changes explicit in the final response.

## Outputs

The script writes:

- `report.md`: Chinese Markdown analysis report.
- `report.html`: interactive Chinese HTML report with summary cards, charts, sortable tables, category detail tabs, search, and collapsible refund sections.
- `category_pie.svg`: refund-aware category pie chart.
- `daily_spending.svg`: daily spending bar+line chart.
- `transactions_parsed.csv`: all parsed rows with section and exclusion metadata.
- `transactions_cleaned.csv`: positive spending rows after matched-refund exclusions.

## Validation

After script changes, run:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile scripts/analyze_cmb_credit_card_bill.py
python3 -m xml.etree.ElementTree '<out>/category_pie.svg'
python3 -m xml.etree.ElementTree '<out>/daily_spending.svg'
```

When a statement contains a visible本期应还金额, sanity-check whether `净账单口径` equals or explains the statement balance.
