# CCB Skills

English | [简体中文](README.md)

A credit-card statement analysis skill for coding agents. CCB is short for Credit Card Bill. It helps Codex or Claude Code convert Chinese credit-card statement PDFs to Markdown, parse transaction details, exclude refunded purchases, and generate spending categories, daily spending trends, an interactive HTML report, and CSV exports.

## Features

- Convert credit-card statement PDFs to Markdown with MarkItDown.
- Parse CMB-style sections: `还款`, `分期`, `退款`, and `消费`.
- Match equal-amount refunds to earlier positive transactions and exclude the matched charge from spending charts.
- Classify spending into categories such as `出行交通`, `食堂`, `其他饮食/食品商超`, `电商购物`, and more.
- Generate `report.html`, `report.md`, SVG charts, and CSV exports; the HTML report supports clicking the category pie chart and daily spending chart to filter details.

## Quickstart (30-Second Setup)

```bash
npx inskills@latest add Redbean3/ccb-skills
```

Non-interactive installs:

```bash
npx inskills@latest add Redbean3/ccb-skills --codex
npx inskills@latest add Redbean3/ccb-skills --claude-code
npx inskills@latest add Redbean3/ccb-skills --all
```

After installation, ask your coding agent to use the skill:

```text
Use $ccb to analyze this credit-card statement PDF.
```

## Migrating From The Old Name

The old skill name was `credit-card-bill-analysis`. The new skill name is `ccb`. After reinstalling, the new directories are:

```text
${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/ccb
${CLAUDE_HOME:-~/.claude}/skills/ccb
```

If you installed the old version, you can manually remove the old directories:

```text
${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/credit-card-bill-analysis
${CLAUDE_HOME:-~/.claude}/skills/credit-card-bill-analysis
```

## Usage

The skill guides the agent through:

1. Converting the PDF with MarkItDown:

```bash
uvx --from 'markitdown[all]' markitdown statement.pdf -o statement.md
```

2. Running the bundled analyzer:

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_cmb_credit_card_bill.py statement.md
```

3. Reviewing generated files, especially `report.html`.

## Outputs

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `report.html` | Interactive HTML report with summary cards, clickable charts, sortable tables, category detail tabs, search, and collapsible refund sections. |
| `report.md` | Markdown report. |
| `category_pie.svg` | Category pie chart. |
| `daily_spending.svg` | Daily spending bar/line chart. |
| `transactions_parsed.csv` | Full parsed transaction export. |
| `transactions_cleaned.csv` | Cleaned spending export after matched-refund exclusions. |

## Privacy

This repository intentionally contains no real statement PDFs, converted statement text, generated reports, or transaction data.

Do not commit real statement PDFs, converted Markdown files, generated HTML/Markdown reports, or CSV exports. The `.gitignore` blocks common inputs and outputs created by this workflow.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+ recommended for the analyzer.
- `uv` and MarkItDown for PDF conversion.
- No third-party Python packages are required by the analyzer itself.
